# NucTool
Use statistical physics to predict nucleosome positions

This is the code described in "Sequence-based prediction of single nucleosome positioning and genome-wide nucleosome occupancy" (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1205659109). 

Please make sure that you add enough DNA on both sides ( >1000bp, which you may want to discard later if you don't use it), to make sure that edge-effects will not dominate. 1000 bp on both sides should suffice. Unless you are particularly interested in the nucleosome positioning effects of DNA ends.
